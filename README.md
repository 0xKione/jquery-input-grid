## Status
I am still actively contributing to this repository making improvements and bug fixes. This is my first real GitHub/Bower library so there have been a few unneccesary releases, but I am getting more familiar with that process.

This library was originally designed to work with a web app I am developing called [WageKick](https://wagekick.com) and turned into a side project.
